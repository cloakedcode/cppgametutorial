In case you haven't already figured it out, that means this is: a tutorial on how to build games in C++.

This was written by [two](http://github.com/schiem) [guys](http://github.com/cloakedcode) for a friend, who has very little programming experience, to better explain programming and get his feet wet with some C++ game developement.

This is _not_ meant to be an all-purpose introduction to game development as the material is focused on creating an ASCII roguelike computer game.
