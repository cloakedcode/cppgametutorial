 * Introduction to classes (similar to Terror in ASCII Dungeon)
    * Character class
    * World class
 * Introduction to game loops
     * Make a basic game loop
 * Introduction to variables
     * Implement the variables in the character and world class
     * Introduction to memory, dynamic memory, vectors and linked lists
         * Cover pointers, references, and memory management?
 * Introduction to functions
     * Functions for math people
     * Functions for non-math people
     * Implement the character move
     * Implement the character attack
     * Implement the ai...but wait...our character shouldn't use AI... 
 * Introduction to inheritence
     * Separate the enemy and the character into two different classes
     * But wait...that's a lot of the same code.  Inheritance!
 * Introduction to AI
     * Suuuuper simple path finding and attacking
 * Key events
     * Now our enemy is moving, but we can't.  Poll for key events!
     * Call functions in our player when keys are pressed!
 * Introduction to procedural generation
     * The world is boring, let's fix that
     * Add a tile class
     * Make a really basic dungeon generation algorithm
     * Use this as an introduction to algorithms in procedural generation
         * Add a room class
         * Generate a dungeon
     * Brief discussion on what you want to procedurally generate, let the user
       decide (make all the enemies or scale them up randomly based on dungeon level)

 * That should cover:
      Functions
      Variables
      Classes
      Memory management
      Inheritence
      Game loops/loops in general
      How a game basically works
      Procedural Generation
      Intro to Algorithms
      Polling for key events
      How to divvy up c++ code (headers and source)

 * Cover game states
     * loading screen
     * game screen
     * death screen

 * Add a few things, like items, experience and levels
